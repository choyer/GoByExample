# Constants NOTES 

- Once a constant is declared it is **immutable**
- Like variables, multiple constants can be declared in a single `const` block
- Value must be know at at **compile time** (e.g. cannot be assigned as the result of a function)
- idiomatic Go convention for naming is to use `CamelCase` with first letter determining accessibility (*uppercase* for exported, *lowercase* for package-level)
