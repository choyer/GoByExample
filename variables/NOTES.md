# Variables NOTES

- In the example `var b, c int = 1, 2`, the type `int` should be omitted as Go will infer the type of initialized variables and thus it is not required (unless you wish to override type inference).
- `:=` is shorthand for declaring and initializing a variable. `f := "apple"` is the same as `f string = "apple"`
