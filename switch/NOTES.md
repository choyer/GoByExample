#switch NOTES

- The expression in the `switch` statement is optional. If omitted, the `switch` defaults to `switch true`, allowing the use of boolean expressions in the `case` statements.
- An optional initialization statement (like in `if` and `for` statements) can include an optional short variable declaration that is scope limited to the `switch` block.
